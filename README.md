Fork of `grouped-window-list@cinnamon.org` where the `cycle` option first switches to the application, then cycles on subsequent clicks.

To install: [Download the zip](https://github.com/Epskampie/grouped-window-list-epskampie/archive/master.zip) and decompress it in `~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/grouped-window-list@epskampie`. Then rightclick the panel and select `applets` to add it.
Don't forget to configure the applet. Change `left click action` to `active, then cycle`.
